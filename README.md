## Why?

Most release tools require Node.js, a pile of plugins, and still only handle the tagging step. **sr** is a single static binary that handles everything:

- **Automated releases** — bumps versions, generates changelogs, tags, and publishes GitHub releases
- **Release channels** — named channels (canary, rc, stable) for trunk-based promotion
- **Agent skill** — ships as a portable [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and other AI tools
- **Single static binary** — no runtime, no package manager, no async runtime
- **Language-agnostic** — works with any project that uses git tags for versioning
- **Zero-config defaults** — conventional commits + semver + GitHub releases out of the box

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize config (creates sr.yaml)
sr init

# Check status — version, unreleased commits, PRs
sr status

# Execute the release
sr release

# Preview without making changes
sr release --dry-run

# Set up shell completions (bash)
sr completions bash >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Installation

### Shell installer (Linux/macOS)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urmzd/sr/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer automatically adds `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` in your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or `config.fish`).

### GitHub Action (recommended)

```yaml
- uses: urmzd/sr@v7
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Minimal — release on every push to `main`:

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
```

Dry-run on pull requests:

```yaml
      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
        with:
          dry-run: "true"
```

Use outputs in subsequent steps:

```yaml
      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
        id: sr
      - if: steps.sr.outputs.released == 'true'
        run: echo "Released ${{ steps.sr.outputs.version }}"
```

Verify the downloaded sr binary with a SHA256 checksum:

```yaml
      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
        with:
          sha256: "abc123..."
```

For maximum security, pin the action to a full-length commit SHA:

```yaml
      - uses: urmzd/sr@<commit-sha>
        with:
          sha256: "abc123..."
```

Manual re-trigger with `workflow_dispatch` (useful when a previous release partially failed):

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: "Re-release the current tag"
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
        with:
          force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force || 'false' }}
```

### Binary download

Download the latest release for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/urmzd/sr/releases):

| Target | File |
|--------|------|
| Linux x86_64 (glibc) | `sr-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux aarch64 (glibc) | `sr-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux x86_64 (musl/static) | `sr-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Linux aarch64 (musl/static) | `sr-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| macOS x86_64 | `sr-x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS aarch64 | `sr-aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows x86_64 | `sr-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |

The MUSL variants are statically linked and work on any Linux distribution (Alpine, Debian, RHEL, etc.). Prefer these for maximum compatibility.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
chmod +x sr-* && mv sr-* ~/.local/bin/sr
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on your `$PATH`.

### Build from source

```bash
cargo install --path crates/sr-cli
```

## Prerequisites

`sr release` calls the GitHub REST API directly — no external tools are needed. Authentication is via an environment variable:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx   # or GITHUB_TOKEN
```

The GitHub Action sets this automatically via the `github-token` input. Dry-run mode (`sr release --dry-run`) works without a token.

## GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

`sr` works with GitHub Enterprise Server out of the box. The hostname is auto-detected from your git remote URL — changelog links, compare URLs, and API calls will point to the correct host automatically.

### Setup

Set your `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) environment variable with a token that has access to your GHES instance:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

No additional host configuration is needed — `sr` derives the API base URL from the git remote hostname automatically (e.g. `ghes.example.com` → `https://ghes.example.com/api/v3`).

### How it works

1. `sr` reads the `origin` remote URL and extracts the hostname (e.g. `ghes.example.com`).
2. Changelog links and compare URLs use `https://<hostname>/owner/repo/...` instead of hardcoded `github.com`.
3. REST API calls are routed to `https://<hostname>/api/v3/...` automatically.

## Branch Protection

If your repository requires signed commits or restricts direct pushes to the release branch, use a **GitHub App** to authenticate `sr`. Commits pushed with a GitHub App installation token are automatically signed by GitHub and can bypass branch rulesets.

### Setup

**1. Create a GitHub App**

- Go to **GitHub Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**
- Name: e.g. `sr-bot`
- Homepage URL: your repo URL
- Uncheck **Webhook → Active**
- Repository permissions: **Contents → Read & write**
- Where can this app be installed: **Only on this account**
- Create the app, then **Generate a private key**
- Install the app on your repositories

**2. Store secrets**

Add these as repository or organization secrets:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `SR_APP_ID` | The App ID (from the App's settings page) |
| `SR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | The downloaded `.pem` file contents |

**3. Configure repository rulesets**

> Use **repository rulesets**, not legacy branch protection. Legacy branch protection does not support GitHub App bypass for signed commit requirements.

- Go to **repo Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset**
- Target branch: `main`
- Enable: **Require signed commits**, **Require a pull request before merging**
- Add your GitHub App to the **Bypass list**

### Workflow example

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Generate App token
        id: app-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.SR_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.SR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}

      - uses: urmzd/sr@v7
        with:
          github-token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
```

## Lifecycle Hooks

sr runs per-package hooks at key points in the release lifecycle. Each hook event is configured under `packages[].hooks` in `sr.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - path: .
    hooks:
      pre_release:
        - "cargo test --workspace"
      post_release:
        - "./scripts/notify-slack.sh"
```

**Available events:**

| Event | When it runs |
|-------|-------------|
| `pre_release` | After version files are bumped, before git commit/tag (e.g. build with bumped versions) |
| `post_release` | After GitHub release and artifact upload (e.g. publish to registry) |

Release hooks receive `SR_VERSION` and `SR_TAG` environment variables.

## Post-release Hooks

`sr` outputs structured JSON to stdout, making it easy to trigger post-release actions.

### GitHub Actions

Use the action outputs to run steps conditionally:

```yaml
- uses: urmzd/sr@v7
  id: sr
- if: steps.sr.outputs.released == 'true'
  run: ./deploy.sh ${{ steps.sr.outputs.version }}
- if: steps.sr.outputs.released == 'true'
  run: |
    curl -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" \
      -d "{\"text\": \"Released v${{ steps.sr.outputs.version }}\"}"
```

### CLI

Pipe `sr release` output to downstream scripts:

```bash
# Extract the version
VERSION=$(sr release | jq -r '.version')

# Feed JSON into a custom script
sr release | my-post-release-hook.sh

# Publish to a package registry after release
VERSION=$(sr release | jq -r '.version')
if [ -n "$VERSION" ]; then
  npm publish
fi
```

### JSON output schema

`sr release` prints a JSON object to stdout on success:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "previous_version": "1.2.2",
  "tag": "v1.2.3",
  "bump": "patch",
  "floating_tag": "v1",
  "commit_count": 4
}
```

All diagnostic messages go to stderr, so stdout is always clean JSON (or empty on exit code 2).

## CLI Reference

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sr release` | Execute a release (tag + GitHub release) |
| `sr status` | Show branch, version, unreleased commits, and open PRs |
| `sr config` | Validate and display resolved configuration |
| `sr init` | Create default config file (`sr.yaml`) |
| `sr completions` | Generate shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, powershell, elvish) |
| `sr update` | Update sr to the latest version |
| `sr migrate` | Show migration guide to the latest sr version |

### Common flags

```bash
sr release -p core              # target a specific monorepo package
sr release -c canary            # release via named channel
sr release --dry-run            # preview without making changes
sr release --force              # re-release the current tag (for partial failure recovery)
sr release --prerelease alpha   # produce pre-release versions (e.g. 1.2.0-alpha.1)
sr release --sign-tags          # sign tags with GPG/SSH (git tag -s)
sr release --draft              # create GitHub release as a draft
sr release --artifacts "dist/*" # upload artifacts to the release
sr release --stage-files Lock   # stage additional files in the release commit
sr status --format json         # machine-readable status output
sr status -p cli                # status for a specific package
sr config --resolved            # show config with defaults applied
sr init --force                 # overwrite existing config files
sr completions bash             # generate Bash completions
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success — a release was created (or dry-run completed). The released version is printed to stdout. |
| `1` | Real error — configuration issue, git failure, VCS provider error, etc. |
| `2` | No releasable changes — no new commits or no releasable commit types since the last tag. |

### `--force` flag

Use `--force` to re-run a release that partially failed (e.g. the tag was created but artifact upload failed). Force mode only works when HEAD is exactly at the latest tag — it re-executes the release pipeline for that tag without bumping the version.

```bash
# Re-release the current tag after a partial failure
sr release --force
```

Force mode will error if:
- There are no tags yet (nothing to re-release)
- HEAD is not at the latest tag (there are new commits — use a normal release instead)

## Configuration

`sr` looks for `sr.yaml` in the repository root. All fields are optional and have sensible defaults.

Running `sr init` generates a fully-commented `sr.yaml` with every available option documented inline.

### Configuration reference

```

### Supported version files

| Filename | Key updated | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | `package.version` or `workspace.package.version` | TOML parser | Preserves formatting/comments. Also updates `[workspace.dependencies]` entries that have both `path` and `version` fields. **Auto-discovers workspace members** |
| `package.json` | `version` | JSON parser | Pretty-printed output with trailing newline. **Auto-discovers npm workspace members** |
| `pyproject.toml` | `project.version` or `tool.poetry.version` | TOML parser | Preserves formatting/comments. Supports both PEP 621 and Poetry layouts. **Auto-discovers uv workspace members** |
| `pom.xml` | First `<version>` after `</parent>` (or `</modelVersion>`) | Regex | Skips the `<parent>` block to avoid changing the parent version |
| `build.gradle` | `version = '...'` or `version = "..."` | Regex | Only replaces the first match (avoids changing dependency versions) |
| `build.gradle.kts` | `version = "..."` | Regex | Only replaces the first match |
| `*.go` | `var Version = "..."` or `const Version string = "..."` | Regex | Matches the first `Version` variable/constant declaration |

#### Workspace auto-discovery

When bumping a workspace root, `sr` automatically finds and bumps all member manifests — no need to list them individually in `version_files`:

| Ecosystem | Root indicator | Members discovered via |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Cargo** | `[workspace]` with `members` | `workspace.members` globs → member `Cargo.toml` files (skips `version.workspace = true`) |
| **npm** | `workspaces` array in `package.json` | `workspaces` globs → member `package.json` files (skips members without `version`) |
| **uv** | `[tool.uv.workspace]` with `members` | `tool.uv.workspace.members` globs → member `pyproject.toml` files (skips members without `version`) |

For example, a Cargo workspace only needs the root listed:

```yaml
packages:
  - path: .
    version_files:
      - Cargo.toml    # automatically bumps all workspace member Cargo.toml files
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Context | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Release | GitHub API token for creating releases and uploading artifacts. Not needed for `--dry-run` |
| `SR_VERSION` | Release hooks | The new version string (e.g. `1.2.3`), set for `pre_release` and `post_release` hooks |
| `SR_TAG` | Release hooks | The new tag name (e.g. `v1.2.3`), set for `pre_release` and `post_release` hooks |

### Commit types

Commit types are grouped by their bump level under `commit.types`:

```yaml
commit:
  types:
    minor:
      - feat
    patch:
      - fix
      - perf
      - refactor
    none:
      - docs
      - revert
      - chore
      - ci
      - test
      - build
      - style
```

The commit pattern is derived automatically from the type names. Any commit type not listed is silently ignored.

Breaking changes are detected in two ways per the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec:

1. **`!` suffix** — e.g. `feat!: new API` or `fix(core)!: rename method`
2. **`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer** — a line starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `BREAKING-CHANGE:` in the commit body

Either form triggers a `major` bump regardless of the type's configured bump level.

#### Default commit-type mapping

| Type | Bump | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `feat` | minor | |
| `fix` | patch | |
| `perf` | patch | |
| `refactor` | patch | |
| `docs` | none | |
| `revert` | none | |
| `chore` | none | |
| `ci` | none | |
| `test` | none | |
| `build` | none | |
| `style` | none | |

Types in the `none` group do not trigger a release on their own. Changelog sections are configured separately under `changelog.groups`.

### Changelog behavior

When `changelog.file` is set:
- If the file doesn't exist, it's created with a `# Changelog` heading
- If it already exists, new entries are inserted after the first heading (prepended, not appended)
- Each entry has the format: `## <version> (<date>)`
- Sections appear in the order defined in `changelog.groups`
- Commits link to their full SHA on GitHub when the repo URL is available

### Changelog templates

Set `changelog.template` to a path pointing to a [minijinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja) (Jinja2-compatible) template file for full control over changelog output. When set, the default markdown format is bypassed entirely.

**Template context:**

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `entries` | `ChangelogEntry[]` | Array of release entries (newest first) |
| `entries[].version` | `string` | Version string (e.g. `1.2.3`) |
| `entries[].date` | `string` | Release date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `entries[].commits` | `ConventionalCommit[]` | Array of commits in this release |
| `entries[].compare_url` | `string?` | GitHub compare URL (may be null) |
| `entries[].repo_url` | `string?` | Repository URL (may be null) |
| `entries[].commits[].sha` | `string` | Full commit SHA |

**Example template:**

```yaml
changelog:
  file: CHANGELOG.md
  template: changelog.md.j2
```

`changelog.md.j2`:

```jinja
{% for entry in entries %}
## {{ entry.version }} ({{ entry.date }})
{% for c in entry.commits %}
- {% if c.scope %}**{{ c.scope }}**: {% endif %}{{ c.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Release execution order

1. **Parse commits** — determine version bump from commits since last tag
2. **Bump version files** — all configured `packages[].version_files` are updated on disk
3. **Write changelog** — the changelog file is written (if configured)
4. **Package `pre_release` hooks** — build or prepare artifacts with the bumped versions (e.g. `cargo build --release`)
5. **Git commit** — version files + changelog + `stage_files` are staged and committed as `chore(release): <tag> [skip ci]`
6. **Create and push tag** — annotated tag at HEAD (signed with GPG/SSH when `git.sign_tags: true`)
7. **Create/update floating tag** (if `git.floating_tag: true`)
8. **Create or update GitHub release** — uses PATCH to preserve existing assets on re-runs; supports `draft` mode
9. **Upload artifacts** — MIME-type-aware uploads to the GitHub release (collected from all packages)
10. **Package `post_release` hooks** — publish to registries, send notifications (e.g. `cargo publish`)

Steps 6-9 are idempotent — re-running with `--force` will skip already-completed steps.

### Release channels

Channels model trunk-based promotion — channels specify which branch they release from and optional pre-release identifiers:

```yaml
channels:
  default: stable
  branch: main
  content:
    - name: canary
      prerelease: canary
    - name: rc
      prerelease: rc
      draft: true
    - name: stable
```

```bash
sr release --channel canary     # 1.2.0-canary.1
sr release --channel rc         # 1.2.0-rc.1
sr release                      # 1.2.0 (stable, uses default channel)
```

**Channel fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | — (required) | Channel name |
| `prerelease` | `string?` | `null` | Pre-release identifier. None = stable |
| `draft` | `bool` | `false` | Create GitHub release as draft |

### Pre-releases

Set `prerelease` on a channel to produce versions like `1.2.0-alpha.1` instead of `1.2.0`:

```yaml
channels:
  default: stable
  branch: main
  content:
    - name: alpha
      prerelease: alpha
    - name: stable
```

Or via CLI: `sr release --prerelease alpha`

**Behavior:**
- The version is based on the latest *stable* tag (pre-release tags are skipped when computing the base)
- The counter auto-increments by scanning existing tags: `1.2.0-alpha.1` → `1.2.0-alpha.2` → ...
- Switching identifiers resets the counter: `1.2.0-alpha.3` → `1.2.0-beta.1`
- The GitHub release is marked as a pre-release
- Floating tags are not updated for pre-releases
- Stable releases (`prerelease: null`) skip over pre-release tags entirely

### Monorepo support

For repositories containing multiple independently versioned packages, use the `packages` config:

```yaml
packages:
  - path: crates/core
    version_files:
      - crates/core/Cargo.toml
  - path: crates/cli
    tag_prefix: "cli-v"              # default: derived from path
    version_files:
      - crates/cli/Cargo.toml
    stage_files:
      - crates/cli/Cargo.lock
```

Each package is released independently — commits are filtered by path, so only changes touching a package's directory trigger its release. Tags are scoped per package (e.g. `core/v1.2.0`, `cli-v3.0.0`).

Use `-p/--package` to target a specific package:

```bash
sr release -p core                # release only the core package
sr status -p cli --format json    # preview next release for cli
```

All other config fields (`commit.types`, `channels`, etc.) are shared across all packages.

When `packages` is empty or absent, `sr` behaves as a single-package tool.

### Limitations

- **GitHub only** — the `VcsProvider` trait exists for extensibility, but only GitHub is implemented

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

<!-- fsrc src="docs/FAQ.md" -->
### Non-conventional commits are silently ignored

sr only understands commits that match the configured commit pattern (derived from type names defined in `commit.types`; follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) by default). Commits that don't match — merge commits, JIRA-style messages, freeform text — are silently skipped during release planning. They won't trigger a version bump or appear in the changelog.

This means:
- **Merge commits** (`Merge pull request #123 from...`) — ignored, no impact
- **Squash merges with conventional titles** (`feat: add search`) — work perfectly
- **JIRA-style commits** (`PROJ-1234: fix login`) — ignored
- **Dependabot commits** (`Bump serde from 1.0 to 1.1`) — ignored
- **Freeform messages** (`fixed the bug`, `wip`) — ignored

If *all* commits since the last tag are non-conventional, sr exits with code 2 (no releasable changes).

### How merge strategies affect sr

sr reads the commit history from HEAD back to the latest tag. It doesn't care *how* commits landed on the branch — only what the commit messages say.

| Strategy | What sr sees | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Merge commit** (default) | The merge commit itself (`Merge pull request...`) + all individual commits from the branch | Merge commit is ignored (non-conventional). Individual commits are parsed normally. |
| **Squash merge** | A single commit with the PR title as the message | Works perfectly if the PR title is conventional (e.g. `feat: add search`). |
| **Rebase merge** | All individual commits replayed onto the branch | Each commit is parsed independently. Same as regular commits. |
| **Fast-forward** | All individual commits | Same as rebase. |

**Recommendation:** Squash merges with conventional PR titles give the cleanest release history — one commit per PR, one changelog entry per feature/fix.

### `sr release` exits with code 2

Exit code 2 means **no releasable commits** were found since the last tag. This is not an error — it means all commits since the last release are either non-bumping types (e.g. `chore`, `docs`, `ci`) or non-conventional messages that were skipped. To force a release anyway, use `sr release --force`.

### Changelog is not generated

Set `changelog.file` in `sr.yaml` — changelog generation is opt-in:

```yaml
changelog:
  file: CHANGELOG.md
```

### Version files not updated

Ensure your manifest files are listed in `packages[].version_files` and match a [supported format](#supported-version-files).

### Tags are not signed

Set `git.sign_tags: true` in `sr.yaml` or pass `--sign-tags`. You must have a GPG or SSH signing key configured in git (`git config user.signingkey`).

### Migrating from v6.x

Run `sr migrate` to see the full migration guide, or read [migration.md](crates/sr-cli/docs/migration.md).

## Architecture

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`sr-core`](crates/sr-core/) | Everything: config, release logic, git, GitHub API |
| [`sr-cli`](crates/sr-cli/) | CLI binary — command handlers, argument parsing |

`action.yml` in the repo root is the GitHub Action composite wrapper.

`sr` uses a pluggable `VcsProvider` trait and currently ships with GitHub support. GitLab, Bitbucket, and other providers can be added as separate crates implementing the same trait.

### Core traits

| Trait | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GitRepository` | Tag discovery, commit listing, tag creation, push |
| `VcsProvider` | Remote release creation, updates, asset uploads, verification |
| `CommitParser` | Raw commit to conventional commit |
| `ChangelogFormatter` | Render changelog entries to text |
| `ReleaseStrategy` | Orchestrate plan + execute |

## Design Philosophy

1. **Trunk-based flow** — releases happen from a single branch; no release branches.
2. **Conventional commits as source of truth** — commit messages drive versioning.
3. **Zero-config** — works out of the box with reasonable defaults.
4. **Language-agnostic** — sr knows about git and semver, not about cargo or npm.
5. **Skills-native** — AI assistants use sr through portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io), not baked-in AI backends or protocol servers.

## Development

```bash
cargo test --workspace    # run tests
cargo clippy --workspace  # lint
cargo build               # build
```

## Agent Skill

This project ships an [Agent Skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) for use with Claude Code, Cursor, and other compatible agents.

Available as portable agent skills in [`skills/`](skills/).

Once installed, use `/sr` to plan, dry-run, or execute releases from conventional commits.
